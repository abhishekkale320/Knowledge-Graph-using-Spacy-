    "# What is Knowledge Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "A knowledge graph is an organized representation of real-world entities and their relationships. It is typically stored in a graph database, which natively stores the relationships between data entities. Entities in a knowledge graph can represent objects, events, situations, or concepts. The relationships between these entities capture the context and meaning of how they are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "A knowledge graph stores data and relationships alongside frameworks known as organizing principles. They can be thought of as rules or categories around the data that provide a flexible, conceptual structure to drive deeper data insights. The usefulness of a knowledge graph lies in the way it organizes the principles, data, and relationships to surface new knowledge for your user or business. The design is useful for many usage patterns, including real-time applications, search and discovery, and grounding generative AI for question-answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, people overcomplicate the concept of a knowledge graph. You might hear about enterprise-wide structures that consolidate and connect information across data silos and various sources. While that does describe a knowledge graph (one that can underpin a data integration use case), it describes one with a wide scope. Thinking only in terms of bridging large datasets and multiple data sources can make creating and implementing knowledge graphs seem complicated and time-consuming. But knowledge graphs don’t need to be broad or elaborate. You can build one with a much smaller scope to solve a use-case-specific problem.\n",
    "#https://neo4j.com/blog/what-is-knowledge-graph/\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "A knowledge graph is a way to organize and connect information in a format that shows how different things (called \"entities\") relate to each other. These entities could be anything, such as people, places, products, or ideas. What makes knowledge graphs powerful is that they not only store the entities but also the relationships between them, making it easier to understand how things are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features of a Knowledge Graph:\n",
    "Entities: These are the building blocks of a knowledge graph. An entity can be a person (like \"Albert Einstein\"), a place (like \"New York City\"), or even a concept (like \"gravity\"). Entities represent real-world things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationships: Knowledge graphs also store the connections between entities. For example, \"Albert Einstein worked in Princeton\" or \"gravity affects all objects on Earth.\" These connections help to capture the meaning of how entities relate to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizing Principles: These are rules or categories that help structure the knowledge graph. They create a flexible framework that helps users find patterns, gain insights, or discover new information by making sense of the relationships between entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph Database: A knowledge graph is usually stored in a graph database, which is designed specifically to handle relationships between data. Unlike traditional databases that store data in tables, graph databases store entities as \"nodes\" and relationships as \"edges\" that connect them, making it easier to explore and analyze"

    "# Knowledge Graphs — What, Why, and How\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Knowledge?\n",
    "To understand the application of the Knowledge Graph, the first thing we need more clarity on is ‘Knowledge’.\n",
    "\n",
    "A unit of knowledge can be defined as a piece of information that allows users to reach an outcome when confronted with specific questions. Knowledge in the real world can be classified into three high-level categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "Situational Knowledge: Changes based on events, situations, or circumstances\n",
    "Layered Knowledge: Spans various layers through associations and relations\n",
    "Evolving Knowledge: Changes context and meaning based on new information\n",
    "Different types of knowledge are interchanged across people, processes, and tools. The job of the knowledge graph is to ensure the interchange is manageable at scale, is uncorrupted, and is easily discoverable.\n",
    "![Description of the image](1_Bevcb3CVfkUcjVdcStV0Ww.webp)\n",
    "Image Representation: How a Knowledge Graph transforms raw data into Knowledge (Source)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Knowledge Graph?\n",
    "Now that we have a specific understanding of Knowledge, let’s dive into the nuances of a Knowledge Graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "A knowledge graph is a semantic web of entities, relationships, and events. More fundamentally, it is a directed graph where every element is populated with rich information regarding itself and its relationships with other elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Knowledge Graph is tasked with surfacing up-to-date and related information to users based on their specific requirements around data sourced from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "A knowledge graph is a data model for metadata that allows users to explore relationships and identify top datasets relevant to their current query.\n",
    "A knowledge graph interweaves multiple data assets, sources, services, targets, and users to enable logical connections that give meaning to the data.\n",
    "It activates dormant or siloed data by connecting it to the vast network of the data ecosystem, allowing users and machines to start invoking and leveraging vast volumes of data that were previously meaningless due to missing semantics.\n",
    "![Description of the image](1_Ku9Y5jf6FPX3BEuJPd9SHA.webp)\n",
    "Image Source: Snapshot from Neo4j\n",
    "\n",
    "### Every data problem is a knowledge transfer problem, and every knowledge transfer problem can be formalized as a graph. Therefore, every data problem can be formalized as a graph. ~ Stephen Bailey\n",
    "\n",
    "A Knowledge Layer contains information across the three primary layers: Data, Process, and People. This includes information about data lineage, provenance, and governance. But these are not enough. The Knowledge Graph is expected to capture information even around the dynamics of every data asset with the data ecosystem as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Glossary\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantics: Adding semantics means adding context and meaning to arbitrary information.\n",
    "Entity: A real-world object, unit, or idea that is self-sustaining. An entity can talk to other entities via relationships or associations to execute targeted tasks.\n",
    "Data Model: A data model is a visual representation of an organization’s or team’s data components and the relations between them.\n",
    "Dormant data (here): Data that cannot be leveraged by users or data applications because they have lost contextual connections to the core data model. Dormant data, be it of good or poor quality, ends up eating the organization’s resources (time and storage).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why does a Knowledge Graph matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "The end objective of a Knowledge graph is to operationalize knowledge and make it available to users when they feed specific questions to the graph. The outcome of these questions powers integration, data recycling, and analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Knowledge Graph ideology was popularized by Google in 2012 when they publicly attributed their search solution to Knowledge Graphs. Google defined its Knowledge Graph to serve the following objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "Discoverability: Make it easy for users to navigate billions of data points to discover specific Knowledge\n",
    "Knowledge Creation: Offer new or unexpected Knowledge to users through new connections or related results. Users are not looking for it, but it adds value to what they are looking for.\n",
    "Distinguishability: Intuitive search capability that understands the context around which the user is searching and presents results accordingly. For example, searching ‘Apple’ should present the Apple Company or the Fruit.\n",
    "Speed: Surface relevant information within milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does a Knowledge Graph work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The semantic meaning added by Knowledge Graphs is written formally to eliminate ambiguity, make it digestible for both users and machines, and enable automated reasoning to contemplate inferred reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every description is a whole and a partial description\n",
    "In a knowledge graph, the description attributed to any entity or relationship also partially encompasses descriptions for related entities, which is how the big picture of a web-like structure develops.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is, in fact, a key attribute of Knowledge Graphs- descriptions for each component partially describe other components. For example, while describing the entity ‘Cat’ as a mammal that hunts rats, the description of the entity ‘Rat’ and ‘Mammal’ gets partially defined: ‘Rat’ eaten by ‘Cat’ & ‘Mammal’ contains ‘Cat’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ontology: A Contract\n",
    "Formal semantics is the process of defining meaning and context for objects through formal computational and logical tools. A Knowledge Graph can be achieved through formal semantics and ontology is the foundation of formal semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ontology is the classification and explanation of entities and their structure. It ensures both developers and users of the knowledge graph have a shared understanding of data. In other words, ontology serves as the contract that brings a consensus around the meaning of the data between users and creators of the knowledge graph. This objective is achieved through tools such as classes, categories, relationships, or even human-friendly textual descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ontology & Taxonomy: The Difference\n",
    "While taxonomies are a way to define hierarchical structures or relationships, Ontology goes a step further to add richer information to the data. Ontology is a superset of Taxonomy and can define interrelationships between the entities in the taxonomy. Therefore, an ontology can contain multiple taxonomies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Description Framework (RDF)\n",
    "RDF is a type of data model that enables users to run CRUD operations on the data without affecting the physical data. It is a standard framework for interchanging highly interconnected data. Through RDF, users can unify or integrate data from various sources while detaching the original data and run queries on the entire global data instead of querying scattered data instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "RDFs enable Knowledge Graphs to entail the attributes of multiple data management models:\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases: Allows queried search across all data assets pulled in from various sources as if the query is on one global data asset.\n",
    "Graphs: Allows analysis on a networked structure.\n",
    "Knowledge Bases: Allows interpretation of context around every data asset and inference of new facts through formal semantics.\n",
    "Nodes. Edges. Properties.\n",
    "On a fundamental level, a knowledge graph has three structural elements: Nodes, Edges, and Labels. Nodes are logical representations of real-world entities, edges are directed logical representations of the connections between these entities, and Properties are logical descriptions or features of the Nodes and Edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real-world entities could be a data asset, a concept, a service, or a user, while relationships could define hierarchical associations (’subset of’), locations (’contains’), definitions (’is a’), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and categories are represented through Nodes, Relationships are represented through Edges, and all of them including textual descriptions can be represented through Properties.\n",
    "\n",

    "Image courtesy: Stardog & Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of a Knowledge Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets: A knowledge graph pulls in data from various sources and these datasets tend to frequently change structures and relationships with other data assets.\n",
    "Schemas: Schemas are a structural representation or a framework of the Knowledge Graph. Models such as FIBO, Brick, and others found on schema.org can serve as great reference structures to get started.\n",
    "Identities or Tags: Identities define and classify nodes in the Knowledge Graph.\n",
    "Metadata and Context: Context defines the setting in which the Knowledge exists and is powered through metadata that serves information about and around a data asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI-Augmented Knowledge Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing or NLP is used to augment Knowledge Graphs for semantic enrichment where tags, descriptions, and context are improved through AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the knowledge graph like a digital brain. Every time a human brain learns something new, a neuron connection is developed to retain that information. This neuron connection is triggered when a similar situation arises where that knowledge could be applied.\n",

    "Source: Link\n",
    "\n",
    "With AI-Augmentation, it is possible to develop such connections at the scale every time AI is able to detect new patterns or new relationships between entities. This discovery gets wired into the knowledge graph and starts adding to subsequent queries or knowledge formation.\n",

    "Here's a comparison of several prominent algorithms used in **knowledge graph embeddings** and **graph representation learning**, covering both their strengths and limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Node Embedding Algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Node2Vec**\n",
    "- **Strengths**: Node2Vec introduces biased random walks, allowing it to control the balance between breadth-first (BFS) and depth-first (DFS) searches, making it flexible in capturing both local and global graph structures. It efficiently generates node embeddings that can be used for tasks like node classification, link prediction, and clustering.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: Node2Vec lacks scalability when dealing with very large graphs since it performs many random walks. It also ignores edge features and doesn’t explicitly account for the relationships between nodes.\n",
    "- **Application**: Suitable for community detection and multi-relational data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **DeepWalk**\n",
    "- **Strengths**: DeepWalk applies a purely random walk approach, similar to Word2Vec, which is effective in learning latent representations of nodes. It can capture the social network structure well and is simple to implement.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: It lacks control over the random walk process (no bias like Node2Vec), making it less versatile. It also struggles with scalability and handling unseen nodes in dynamic graphs.\n",
    "- **Application**: Frequently used in social network analysis and recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **GraphSAGE**\n",
    "- **Strengths**: GraphSAGE aggregates features from neighbors, which allows it to generate embeddings for unseen nodes during training, making it highly scalable for large graphs. It’s an inductive model that can generalize to new nodes, unlike Node2Vec and DeepWalk.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: GraphSAGE assumes that node features are available, which may not be the case in all graphs. It may also require more computational resources due to feature aggregation.\n",
    "- **Application**: Works well in dynamic or evolving graphs, such as citation networks or transaction graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **GCN (Graph Convolutional Networks)**\n",
    "- **Strengths**: GCN extends convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to graphs, efficiently aggregating information from neighboring nodes. It’s good at capturing graph-structured data and works well for semi-supervised learning tasks.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: GCNs tend to become less effective as the number of layers increases, leading to the “oversmoothing” problem where node representations become indistinguishable. It also requires labeled data for supervised learning tasks.\n",
    "- **Application**: Primarily used in node classification tasks, such as predicting properties of proteins in biological networks or categorizing nodes in social graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **GAT (Graph Attention Networks)**\n",
    "- **Strengths**: GAT improves upon GCN by introducing attention mechanisms, allowing it to assign different importance to neighboring nodes. This feature makes GAT particularly powerful for handling graphs with varying node connectivity.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: GAT can be computationally expensive due to the attention mechanism. Additionally, it may suffer from overfitting on small datasets.\n",
    "- **Application**: Useful in tasks where specific nodes should have more influence, such as in molecular property prediction or fraud detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Knowledge Graph Embedding Algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **TransE**\n",
    "- **Strengths**: TransE models relations as translations in a low-dimensional space, meaning that if a relation holds between two entities, the embedding of the tail entity should be close to the embedding of the head entity plus the relation. It is computationally efficient and simple to implement.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: TransE struggles with complex relations such as one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. It assumes all relationships can be represented by translations, which may oversimplify the data.\n",
    "- **Application**: Often used in link prediction and knowledge base completion tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **TransR**\n",
    "- **Strengths**: TransR extends TransE by projecting entities and relations into separate vector spaces, which allows it to model more complex relations that TransE cannot handle. It is better at capturing one-to-many and many-to-one relationships.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: TransR increases the number of parameters, which may lead to overfitting on small datasets. It also requires more computational power compared to TransE.\n",
    "- **Application**: Suitable for knowledge base completion where entities and relations belong to distinct domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **RotatE**\n",
    "- **Strengths**: RotatE uses complex numbers to model relations as rotations in the complex plane. It can capture symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, and composition of relations, making it very versatile.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: The use of complex numbers adds computational complexity. Additionally, it may not perform well on simpler graphs where relations are straightforward.\n",
    "- **Application**: Effective for tasks like link prediction in knowledge graphs where relations exhibit complex patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. **ComplEx**\n",
    "- **Strengths**: ComplEx extends embeddings into the complex number space to better capture asymmetric relations. It can model one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations effectively.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: The complex embeddings can be harder to interpret, and the added complexity may increase training time and computational requirements.\n",
    "- **Application**: Commonly used in knowledge graph reasoning tasks that involve complex relational patterns.\n",
    "\n",
